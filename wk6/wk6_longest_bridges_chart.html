    Part 3: Longest US Bridges Chart. (5 points)
        >> 	Use the dataset below to draw a Chart.js bar chart of the bridge names and
        their span lengths.  You can draw the chart on the same page as the map, or you
        can make a new page.

        >> 	Use the array you created in part 2 to avoid typing the data into your program again.
        Don't manually write the data into Chart.js arrays.

        >> 	Your map, and chart, should still work if you replace the bridges below with this:
