    Part 2: Longest US Bridges Map. (7 points)
        >> 	Use the dataset below to draw a Leaflet map showing a marker for each
        of the five bridges with the longest spans in the USA.

        >> 	Put all of this data into an array of objects, and then loop over that array
        to create the markers and popups. Don't create separate markers in your code.

        >> 	Your map should have an appropriate center location and zoom level,
        to show all five bridges. Place a marker at each bridge location.
        Each marker should have a popup with the bridge's name and span length.
        Use HTML to format this information neatly.

    Part 2a (Optional for extra credit +3 points)
        >> 	Instead of the default marker, draw a bridge icon at the locations.
        You'll find a tutorial at Leaflet's website.
        Example icon: https://www.flaticon.com/free-icon/bridge_183412.

        >> 	Examine your bridge data array and use JavaScript to figure out which bridge is longest.
        Draw the marker for this bridge in a different color. You can
        change the colors of an icon if you register for a Flaticon account.
